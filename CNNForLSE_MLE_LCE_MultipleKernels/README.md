CS 615 Deep Learning Himanshu Gupta Assignment 3 (Matlab) README:

Please refer to the Analysis.pdf for graphs and detailed analysis. For
simplicity, I have serialized yalefaces images into database.mat for
faster read and analysis.

1)  "hg387.pdf" is the Report containing all the required findings.
2)  "LSE.m" contains the source code for CNN for LSE Classification
    where: just run the code in Matlab and program plots the required
    figure.
3)  "MLE.m" contains the source code for CNN for MLE Classification
    where: just run the code in Matlab and program plots the required
    figure.
4)  "LCE.m" contains the source code for CNN for LCE Classification
    where: just run the code in Matlab and program plots the required
    figure.
5)  "CNN\_multi.m" contains the source code for CNN with multiple
    kernels where: just run the code in Matlab and program plots the
    required figure.
6)  "ANN.m" contains the source code for first architecture Multi-Kernel
    CNN for Image Classification where: just run the code in Matlab and
    program plots the required figure. Also, for increasing performance,
    I am attaching ANN.mat file which is pre-populated matrix of image
    so first program looks for this file, if not exists then run the
    algorithm by reading images from the directory '/yalefaces'.
7)  "ANN\_2.m" contains the source code for second architecture
    Multi-Kernel CNN for Image Classification where: just run the code
    in Matlab and program plots the required figure. Also, for
    increasing performance, I am attaching ANN.mat file which is
    pre-populated matrix of image so first program looks for this file,
    if not exists then run the algorithm by reading images from the
    directory '/yalefaces'.
8)  The programs are throughly tested and performed well in various
    cases.
