These Projects are implemented utilizing Deep Learning Concepts and its
applications, as well as core machine learning concepts such as data
set, evaluation, overfitting, regularization and more. Covers neural
network building blocks: linear and logistic regression, followed by
shallow artificial neural networks and a variety of deep networks
algorithms and their derivations. Includes implementation of algorithms
and usage of existing machine learning libraries. Explores the usage of
deep learning on a variety of problems including image classification,
speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Objectives achieved through these projects: 
• Implement back propagation
• Derive back propagation rules for various deep learning algorithms 
• Implement a variety of deep learning algorithms from scratch 
• Make use of existing deep learning libraries for training and testing 
• Apply deep learning to a real-world problem and present associated research
and results in the form of a presentation and conference-style paper.
